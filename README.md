# Alfred-Tyme

A simple workflow for [Alfred 2/3](http://www.alfredapp.com/) to control [Tyme](http://tyme-app.com).

Until now, this workflow is used primarily by me and it is therefore far from being without bugs etc.
Feel free to use it but use with caution.

Built with the awesome [Alfred-Workflow](https://github.com/deanishe/alfred-workflow) library (MIT-licensed).


## Features and Usage

- `ty <task>` - Start/Stop every task available in Tyme
- `tya` - See all active tasks (you can also search within this view)
- `tys` - Stop all running tasks
- `tyst` - Show statistics of the current day


## Installation

Just like every other workflow download the `alfred-tyme.workflow` file and open it.

## TODO

Some ideas I plan to include:
- Enable support for subtasks
- Create new projects, tasks
- Change the start/stop time
- Enable adding notes to the task
- Refreshing the list of tasks
