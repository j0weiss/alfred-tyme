# Alfred-Tyme

A simple workflow for [Alfred 3][alfred] to control [Tyme][tyme].

Until now, this workflow is used primarily by me and it is therefore far from beeing without bugs etc.
Feel free to use it but use with caution.

Build with the awesome [Alfred-Workflow][alfred-workflow] library.


## Features

- Start/Stop every task listed in Tyme
- Stop all running tasks


## TODO

Some ideas I plan to include:
- Create new projects, tasks
- Change the start/stop time
